# NST

To run the model replace the content and style images with your image upon which you wants to generate the image by replacing the path in code and run all the cells. Use GPU for fatser results.

Neural Style Transfer
Neural style transfer (NST) is a technique in the field of computer vision that merges the content of one image with the style of another, resulting in a third image that visually combines elements of both. The foundational idea behind NST is to use deep learning algorithms to extract and manipulate features from images, enabling the creation of visually striking results that blend different artistic styles with real-world content.
